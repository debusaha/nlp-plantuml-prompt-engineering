# AI Engineering / Prompt Engineering Project Overview

The repository pertains to the AI Engineering / Prompt Engineering applications, involving the training of Large Language Models (LLMs) for PlantUML code generation and the creation of a backend service using FastAPI, along with a ReactJS frontend to visualize the diagrams.

## Dataset
The dataset for this project is hosted on Hugging Face. You can find it at `coai/plantuml_generation`.

## Part 1 - LLM Training
**Objective**: Train a Large Language Model (LLM) capable of generating PlantUML code from given scenario descriptions.

**Platform**: The training is conducted on Google Colab.

**Deliverable**: A trained LLM with its weights is uploaded to Hugging Face (`https://huggingface.co/debusaha`).

## Part 2 - Backend & Frontend Development
**Backend Development**

**Objective**: A backend service is created using FastAPI that generates PlantUML code from scenarios and converts it into images.

**Frontend Development**

**Objective**: A frontend interface is built with ReactJS that allows users to input scenarios and view the generated PlantUML diagrams.
